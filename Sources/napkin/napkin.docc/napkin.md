# ``napkin``

A Swift 6.2 framework for building app architecture as a tree of small, isolated, composable units — *napkins* — modeled on Uber's RIBs but rebuilt from the ground up around Swift Concurrency.

## Overview

A **napkin** is one node in your application tree. Every napkin is built from a small, fixed set of rings:

| Ring | Isolation | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``Builder`` | `Sendable` class | Constructs the napkin: builds the component, instantiates interactor and router, wires the listener. |
| ``Component`` | `Sendable` class | The DI container. Provides services to this napkin and conforms to its children's `Dependency` protocols. |
| ``Interactable`` | `final actor` | The unit's brain. Holds business state, drives the lifecycle, calls the presenter and router. |
| ``Routing`` | `@MainActor` class | Owns the subtree. Attaches and detaches child routers; in viewable napkins it also owns a view controller. |
| ``Presentable`` | `@MainActor` class | View-state holder. Optional — view controllers can conform directly when there is no separate state to hold. |
| ``ViewControllable`` | `@MainActor` class | The platform view. A `UIHostingController` wrapping a SwiftUI `View`, or any `UIViewController` / `NSViewController`. |

### Why protocol composition over inheritance

Earlier RIBs frameworks shipped an `open class PresentableInteractor<P>` that subclasses extended. Swift Concurrency removes that option. Per [SE-0306](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0306-actors.md), actors cannot be subclassed; per [SE-0316](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0316-global-actors.md), only Apple-blessed types like `MainActor` may be `@globalActor`. A `@MainActor open class` base would put business logic on the main actor, violating the dependency rule of clean architecture.

napkin's answer is protocol composition. ``Interactable`` is a protocol that refines `Actor`; conforming types are `final actor`. A protocol extension on ``Interactable`` provides default implementations of every lifecycle method, forwarding state to a single shared helper, ``InteractorLifecycle``. The result behaves exactly like a base class — overrides, inherited defaults, polymorphic dispatch — without the inheritance.

See <doc:ProtocolCompositionOverInheritance> for the full reasoning, including the primitives table and links to Apple's evolution proposals.

### The actor-isolation map

Each ring lives in a specific isolation domain, and crossings are explicit:

```
                 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                 │  Builder           Sendable class            │
                 │     │ creates                                │
                 │     ▼                                        │
   @MainActor    │  Component         Sendable class            │
                 │     │ injects                                │
                 ▼     ▼                                        │
              Router  ◀───── owns ─────▶  Interactor (final actor)
            (@MainActor)                       │
                 │ owns                        │ awaits
                 ▼                             ▼
            ViewController            Presenter (@MainActor)
            (@MainActor)                       ▲
                 │ dispatch { … }              │ await
                 │                             │
                 └────── View → Interactor ────┘
```

- **Interactor → Presenter** crosses `actor → @MainActor`: `await presenter.update(...)`.
- **Interactor → Router** crosses `actor → @MainActor`: `await router?.routeToProfile()`.
- **View → Interactor** crosses `@MainActor sync → actor`: `dispatch { await listener?.didTap() }`.
- **Interactor → Listener** stays in the listener's actor: `await listener?.fooDidFinish()`.

See <doc:CrossIsolationPatterns> for the full set of directional patterns and when each is appropriate.
